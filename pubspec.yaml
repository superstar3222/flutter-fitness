  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/serdar.jpg
    - assets/images/moon.png
    - assets/images/water.png
    - assets/images/fire.png
    - assets/images/heart.png
    - assets/images/heart_rate.png
    - assets/images/tray.png
    - assets/images/dumbbell.png
    - assets/images/four-squares.png
    - assets/images/add.png
    - assets/images/user.png
    - assets/images/first-aid.png
    - assets/images/scr1.jpg
    - assets/images/scr2.jpg
    - assets/images/calories.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: JosefinSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/JosefinSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/JosefinSans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/JosefinSans-Light.ttf

    - family: Oswald
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oswald-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oswald-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oswald-Light.ttf
